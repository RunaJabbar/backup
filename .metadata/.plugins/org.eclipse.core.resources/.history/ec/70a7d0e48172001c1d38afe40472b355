package hw3Q2JavaVariables;



public class AboutMe {

	//(2) Create a package name "hw3Q2JavaVariables" inside the Home work project, Create a Class name "AboutMe". Declare only one type of variable(so you know declare vs initialize), and initialize String and other 8 types of variable (you can give a different name from mine). Instantiate AboutMe class under main method and call few variables by object (you can use String concatenation to make it more meaningful outcome). Give a single line comment where a variable is declared and initialized. Follow indentation by Organizing the code and paste below. [Mark distribution (80) : using variable --20, instantiate class - 20, call variables by object and print a meaningful outcome 20, comment for variable is declared and initialized - 10, organize code and other-- 10]
